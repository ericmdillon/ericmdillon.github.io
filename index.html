            <p><b>MA English student</b> and teaching assistant at Marshall University with an <b>MPhil in Digital Humanities</b> from the University of Cambridge.</p>
            <p>I'm first and foremost a digital humanist. In stating that, I've often found it necessary to acknowledge what "digital humanities" is. To me, digital humanities is a recognition of the messy, convoluted relationship between technology and culture. In the information era, "culture" is spread through inconsistent modes of communication--social media, videogames, online communication, all existing in twisted, largely nonlinear formats--but also as a consequence of the disparity in digital access across communities and regions.</p>
            <p>I am interested in several areas of this relationship. In completion of my Cambridge degree, my portfolio was focused on the medium of the videogame and its historical and continued dependencies on adaptation and appropriation. I am interested in digitally archiving and preserving Appalachian and southern literature, making underrepresented texts more accessible to a larger population. I am also interested in the concept of the "internet aesthetic," and how superficial categorizations of visuals and various media highlight or revive modes of digital production left in the past.</p>
            <p>I am looking forward to applying to doctoral programs in English, Digital Humanities, Cultural Studies, Media Studies, or related programs with a Fall 2027 start date.</p>
